# TexPipe

Pipeline to generate thumbnails/previews of Graphs from sbsfiles, and collect all the data (sbs, images, metadatas) in proper place for any need (feeding a database for instance)

Very early steps, wokring with just some sample files. To test :

    python3 texpipe.py --graphname=g_basketry_a --sbsname=base_basketry_a
